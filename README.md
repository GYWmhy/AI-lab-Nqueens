# Artificial Intelligence lab: N-queens  
This is the second part of the first programming assignment in course *Artificial Intelligence* in 2018 spring semester.  
Very, very stupid way to finish this N-queens task.  
*Hill-climbing Search* and *Simulated Annealing Search* were asked to be used in this experiment.
